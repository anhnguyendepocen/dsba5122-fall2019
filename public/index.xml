The Truth Continuum (Chapter 3) ‚ÄúAny visualization is a model.‚Äù
‚Äì
‚ÄúThe more adequately a model fits whatever it stands for without being needlessly complex, and the easier it is for its intended audience to interpret it correctly, the better it will be.‚Äù

      <description>You will do all of your visualization work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard‚ÄîR handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.
RStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure.</description>

 By itself, the facts contained in raw data are difficult to understand, and in the absence of beauty and order, it is impossible to understand the truth that the data shows.
In this class, you‚Äôll learn how to use industry-standard graphic and data design techniques to create beautiful, understandable visualizations and uncover truth in data.</description>
