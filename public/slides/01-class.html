.pull-left[
## Visualization Theory &amp; Concepts

- What makes a good visualization?

- What are the best visualization tools for your problem?

- What human factors are important to consider in designing visualizations?
]
.pull-right[
## Data Visualization in Practice

- R: `tidyverse`: core data science for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- R: `htmlwidgets`: instead of JavaScript, D3

- R: `shiny`: instead of HTML/CSS/Server-side

## Course Communication

For many students, a lot of the course material may be very new. 

Many students' first reaction when get first R error message or question on programming is to email me.

**Emailing me should be a last resort!**

## Course Communication: Material Questions

When you have questions R/running things:

1. Google it! If that doesn't work, then...

2. Ask a classmate. If that doesn't work, then...

3. Post your question on the course Slack channel. If that doesn't work, then...

4. Email the TA, Tarun Sharma. Be clear and concise with your question. If that doesn't work, then...

5. Email me at last resort.

&gt; Do not use the excuse 'I'm not a programmer/computer scientist/etc., therefore...'

Data Scientist Creed: If you don't know it, learn it.
