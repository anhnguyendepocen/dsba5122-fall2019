# Introduce yourself

- Name

- What's your academic and professional background?

- Programming (e.g., R, python, JavaScript, SQL) & visualization experience (e.g., Excel, ggplot2, Tableau, Spotfire)

- What are you interested to learn more about data visualizations?

To do by next class: Send me an introduction email <rwesslen@uncc.edu> answering these questions. It's up to you on length. This is my chance to learn about your background.

Two objectives:

.pull-left[
## Visualization Theory & Concepts

- What makes a good visualization?

- What are the best visualization tools for your problem?

- What human factors are important to implement your visualization?
]
.pull-right[
## Data Visualization in Practice

- R: `tidyverse`: core data science for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- R: `htmlwidgets`: instead of JavaScript, D3

- R: `shiny`: instead of HTML/CSS/Server-side

# Grading:

```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points,  ~Assignment,
  10 , "Attendance & Participation",
  10 , "4 Datacamp courses",
  20 , "4 Problem sets",
  20 , "4 Out-of-Class Online Quizzes",
  10 , "Group: Design Contest",
  30 , "Group: Final Project"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points)
         )

grading <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Range,
  "A (Comendable)",  "90% - 100%", 
  "B (Satisfactory)",  "80% â€“ 89.99%", 
  "C (Marginal)",  "70% - 79.99%",
  "U (Unsatisfactory)",  "< 70%"
)
```

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                                Points = sum(assignments$Points))

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% 
  select(Assignment, Points) %>%
  knitr::kable("markdown", align = "cc")
```

```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(grading, "markdown", align = "cc")
```

# Policies:

* No latework accepted. None. None.

* Formal announcements will be sent through email.

  - Informal announcements will be through Slack.
  
  - Canvas will only be for assignment submission and tracking grades.

* Collaboration is encouraged (if allowed)
  
  - Projects in groups of 3 (you select).
  
  - Problem sets can work with 1 other student.
  
  - Cannot work together on quizzes.
  
* RStudio.Cloud is available to run examples.
  
  - Students are encouraged (but not required) to learn to run locally.

## Course Communication

For many students, a lot of the course material may be very new. Early on, many students first reaction when they get their first R error message or question on programming is to email me.

**Email to me should be a last purpose!**

--

When you have questions:

1. Google it! If that doesn't work, then...

2. Ask a classmate. If that doesn't work, then...

3. Post your question on the course Slack channel. If that doesn't work, then...

4. Email the TA. Be clear and concise with your question. If that doesn't work, then...

5. Email me at last resort.

> Do not use the excuse 'I'm not a programmer/computer scientist/etc., therefore...'

Data Scientist Creed: If you don't know it, learn it.
