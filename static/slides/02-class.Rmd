# The Truth Continuum (Chapter 3)

"Any visualization is a model."

--

"The more adequately a model fits whatever it stands for without being needlessly complex, and the easier it is for its intended audience to interpret it correctly, the better it will be."

Why Are We So Often Mistaken?

---

## 1. Patternicity Bug

## 2. Storytelling Bug

## 3. Confirmation Bug

---

# Patternicity Bug

```{r out.width = "650px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/slides/02-class/patternicity.png")
```

---

# Storytelling Bug

---

# Confirmation Bug

--

"The way we present information matters as much as the soundness of the information itself."
