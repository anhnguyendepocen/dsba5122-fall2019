# The Truth Continuum (Chapter 3)

"Any visualization is a model."

--

"The more adequately a model fits whatever it stands for without being needlessly complex, and the easier it is for its intended audience to interpret it correctly, the better it will be."

"Good visualizations shouldnâ€™t oversimplify information. **They need to clarify it.** In many cases, clarifying a subject requires increasing the amount of information, not reducing it."

Why Are We So Often Mistaken?

---

## 1. Patternicity Bug

## 2. Storytelling Bug

## 3. Confirmation Bug

# Patternicity Bug

```{r out.width = "650px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/slides/02-class/patternicity.png")
```

---

# Storytelling Bug

---

# Confirmation Bug

--

"The way we present information matters as much as the soundness of the information itself."

???
When the gray bars share a boundary, the apparent contrast between them appears to increase. Speaking loosely, we can say that our visual system is trying to construct a representation of what it is looking at based more on relative differences in the luminance (or brightness) of the bars, rather than their absolute value. Similarly, the ghostly blobs in the Hermann grid effect can be thought of as a side-effect of the visual system being tuned for a different task.
