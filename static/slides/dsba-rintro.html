# 2. Hanging with the big kids.

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well then. Another take on programming language popularity just published by IEEE Spectrum has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; at 5, edging out JavaScript. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aH2nZSdf2i"&gt;https://t.co/aH2nZSdf2i&lt;/a&gt; an incredible result for a DSL.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Miles McBain (@MilesMcBain) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain/status/1170536600113049600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

# 3. R open source community makes it fun!

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rayshader?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rayshader&lt;/a&gt; comes with a function that can detect bodies of water directly from the elevation data? `detect_water()` looks for large contiguous flat regions of a user-defined minimum size and &amp;quot;flatness.&amp;quot; Use `add_water()` to layer it on the map. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/kBEltc98OH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kBEltc98OH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tyler Morgan-Wall (@tylermorganwall) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall/status/1166338131257438210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" width="50%" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well this R=Batman, Python=Superman apparently showed up in a vendor pitch to one of my colleagues.

# Shiny &lt;img src="https://ericrayanderson.github.io/shinymaterial/img/shinyLogo.png" width="70px" align="right" /&gt;

A Shiny app is a web page (UI) connected to a computer running a live R session (Server).

&lt;img src="../../images/slides/dsba-rintro/shiny.png" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Users can manipulate the UI, which will cause the server to update the UI's displays (by running R code).

# Takeaways

## R/RStudio is not your old base R tools.

### - Tidyverse, shiny, RMarkdown, etc.

--

## Choose the best tool for the job, maybe Excel or Tableau.

### - But if its a data science pipeline + data visualizations: R is hard to compete with.

--

## A lot of times, don't need to choose R vs. Python, C++, JS.

### - Take the best of each and make it into an R package.

--

## Data visualization is part art and science (and design!). 

### - The best way to learn: do it, get feedback, iterate.

---

# Happy R programming!
