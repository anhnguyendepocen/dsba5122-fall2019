# Attendance & Participation

You are expected to attend class and actively participate (e.g., ask questions, provide your perspective). 

You are permitted to miss to have two (2) unexcused absences. Excused absences must be approved before the class.

# DataCamp Courses

<span class="newthought">To reinforce programming concepts, </span> you will need to complete **four** DataCamp courses. Credit will either be granted for completion on time or no credit. These will be assigned on DataCamp and are intended to reinforce the programming assignments and material. **No partial credit will be granted or any late work accepted.**

All four DataCamp courses are available at the beginning of the course. Therefore, you can begin DataCamp courses before we cover the related material.

# Problem sets

<span class="newthought">To practice working with R/RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 4 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded on the following point system:

- Can your results be replicated? e.g., files run, includes .Rmd/.html files + data/images
- Your explanations of the code written in grammatically correct English 
- The correctness of your code

You may (and should!) work with one other person on the problem sets, but you **must** turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than **two** people, and you must note who you worked with on your assignment.

# Quizzes

<span class="newthought">Quizzes</span> are intended to reinforce the lectures and course reading materials. Quizzes will be given out-of-class through Canvas. Each quiz will consist of ten (10) multiple choice questions for each quiz. Quizzes will be closed-book, i.e., you **cannot use any other resource** (no phones, laptops, books, etc.).

I will try to review each quiz in the following class to provide feedback on each quiz. Your grades will be posted on Canvas.

# Design Contest / Mini-Project

<span class="newthought">To give you practice for the final project</span>, you will complete a mini-project halfway through the semester. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questionsâ€”you will make a static visualization plots.

The goal of this project is to give you practice to design visualization solution for an interesting data problem. You are **not** expected to use interactive visualizations (e.g., Shiny, htmlwidgets) since we will not have covered that material in detail. Instead, you need to outline what skills/tools you want to learn more to better for the final project (e.g., what would you want to do if you could).

Feel free to start thinking about ideas (datasets, research questions) now. This will be in groups of no more than 3 students per group.

This project is worth 10% of your final grade. You will have an in-class, 10 minute presentation on **October 28th** and submit your materials in Canvas.

# Final project

<span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.

Project details will be posted later on. This much is certain so far:

- You will use some sort of real-world, interactive data visualization (Shiny-based) some sort of research question.
- The project will consist of a written report and a final 10 minute presentation, which will be during our Exam class on December 9th.

There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.
