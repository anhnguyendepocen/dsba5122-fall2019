# DataCamp Courses

You will need to complete five DataCamp courses, each is 2 points.

# Problem sets

<span class="newthought">To practice working with RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 5 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded using a check system:

- 1 pt: File runs (.Rmd/.html files + data/images)
- 1 pt: Explanations on code (written in English)
- 1 pt: Correct code

You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.

# Code-through

<span class="newthought">The objectives of this class include</span> "Share data and graphics in open forums" and "Be curious and confident in consuming and producing data." To help you with this, you will write a short code-through tutorial of some data visualization principle, technique, or example.

One of the reasons R is so popular is because the R community is exceptionally generous and open and sharing.^[So are Python and other modern open source languages too.] The internet is full of tutorials and code-throughs where people explain how to do something interesting with R.

You will write one code-through or tutorial during the semester on a topic of your choice. Complete details for the assignment (along with a lot of examples to look at) will be given later. You will complete this on your own, but you can get help from others (but you can't all write about the same topic).

The [R-Weekly e-mail newsletter](https://rweekly.org/) includes dozens of these every week, and [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) (chief tidyverse advocate at RStudio) regularly tweets out links to different posts as well. Here are some others examples to give you a jist of what you'll be doing:^[{-} Yours won't be nearly as complicated as these, by the way. Nor do they need to be. You'll illustrate and explain something simple.]

- [The Greatest Twitter Scheme of All Time?](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/2018/08/24/greatest-twitter-scheme/)
- [Mapping Fall Foliage with sf](https://rud.is/b/2017/09/18/mapping-fall-foliage-with-sf/)
- [Exploring Minard's 1812 plot with ggplot2](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/08/10/exploring-minards-1812-plot-with-ggplot2/)
- [Animations in R](https://www.infoworld.com/video/89987/r-tip-animations-in-r)
- [Drone sightings in the US, visualized](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2016/04/03/drone-sightings-in-the-us-visualized/)
- [Quickly play with Polity IV and OECD data (and see the danger of US democracy)](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/08/26/quickly-play-with-polity-iv-and-oecd-data-and-see-the-danger-of-us-democracy/)

This assignment will also be graded with a check system.

# Design Contest / Mini-Project

<span class="newthought">Too give you practice</span> with the data and design principles you'll learn in this class, you will complete a mini-project. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questionsâ€”you will make a static visualization plot.

This is worth *10* points. It will be submitted via Canvas. 

# Final project

<span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.

Project details will be posted later once I settle on the best form for it. This much is certain so far:

- You will use some sort of real-world, public management-related data to explore some sort of research question with multiple graphics
- It will be so much fun!

There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.
