# Attendance & Participation

You are expected to attend class and actively participate (e.g., ask questions, provide your perspective). 

You are permitted to miss to have two (2) unexcused absences. Excused absences must be approved before the class.

# DataCamp Courses

You will need to complete **four** DataCamp courses. Points will be allocated for all (2.5 points) for completion or 0 points (not completed) by the assigned date. These will be assigned on DataCamp and are intended to reinforce the programming assignments and material.

About half-way through the semester (February-March), additional DataCamp courses may be provided for extra credit points.

# Problem sets

<span class="newthought">To practice working with R/RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 4 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded using the following point system:

- 1 pt: File runs (.Rmd/.html files + data/images)
- 2 pts: Explanations on code (written in English)
- 2 pts: Correct code

You may (and should!) work with one other person on the problem sets, but you **must** turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than **two** people, and you must note who you worked with on your assignment.

# Quizzes

<span class="newthought">Quizzes</span> are intended to reinforce the lectures and course reading materials. Quizzes will be given through Canvas and out-of-class and will consist of ten (10) multiple choice questions for each quiz. Quizzes will be closed-book, i.e., you **cannot use any other resource** (no phones, laptops, books, etc.).

I will try to review each quiz in the following class to provide feedback on each quiz. Your grades will be posted on Canvas.

# Design Contest / Mini-Project

<span class="newthought">Too give you practice</span> with the data and design principles you'll learn in this class, you will complete a mini-project. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questionsâ€”you will make a static visualization plots.

Feel free to start thinking about ideas (datasets, research questions) now. This will be in groups of no more than 3 students per group.

This is worth **10** points. It will be submitted via Canvas as well as include an in-class, 10 minute presentation on **October 28th**. 

# Final project

<span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.

Project details will be posted later on. This much is certain so far:

- You will use some sort of real-world, interactive data visualization (Shiny-based) some sort of research question.
- The project will consist of a written report and a final presentation, which will be during our Exam class on December 9th.
- It will be so much fun!

There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.
