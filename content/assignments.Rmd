# DataCamp Courses

You will need to complete five DataCamp courses, each is 2.5 points. Points will be allocated for all (2.5 points) for completion or 0 points (not completed) by the assigned date. These will be assigned on DataCamp and are intended to reinforce the programming assignments and material.

Throughout the semester, additional DataCamp courses will be suggested for extra credit points. 

# Problem sets

<span class="newthought">To practice working with RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 5 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded using a check system:

- 1 pt: File runs (.Rmd/.html files + data/images)
- 2 pts: Explanations on code (written in English)
- 2 pts: Correct code

You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.

# Quizzes

<span class="newthought">Quizzes</span> are intended to reinforce the course reading materials as well as enforce course attendance. Quizzes will be given in class and will consist of five multiple choice questions for each quiz. Each quiz will be announced without prior warning and given out between the class break (between the lecture and lab sections, about halfway through the class). Quizzes will be on paper and without any other resource (no phones, laptops, books, etc.).

Students who are absent will not be able to make up quizzes unless they can provide medical or work related excuses (e.g., traveling for a conference or work-related activities). 

# Design Contest / Mini-Project

<span class="newthought">Too give you practice</span> with the data and design principles you'll learn in this class, you will complete a mini-project. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questionsâ€”you will make a static visualization plot.

This is worth *10* points. It will be submitted via Canvas. 

# Final project

<span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.

Project details will be posted later once I settle on the best form for it. This much is certain so far:

- You will use some sort of real-world, interactive data visualization (Shiny-based) some sort of research question.
- It will be so much fun!

There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.
