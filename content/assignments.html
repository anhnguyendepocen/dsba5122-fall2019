<h2 id="attendance-participation">Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend class and actively participate (e.g., ask questions, provide your perspective).</p>
<p>You are permitted to miss to have two (2) unexcused absences. Excused absences must be approved before the class.</p>
<h2 id="datacamp-courses">DataCamp Courses</h2>
<p>You will need to complete <strong>four</strong> DataCamp courses. Points will be allocated for all (2.5 points) for completion or 0 points (not completed) by the assigned date. These will be assigned on DataCamp and are intended to reinforce the programming assignments and material.</p>
<p>About half-way through the semester (February-March), additional DataCamp courses may be provided for extra credit points.</p>
<h2 id="problem-sets">Problem sets</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To practice working with R/RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 4 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded using the following point system:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pt: File runs (.Rmd/.html files + data/images)</li>
<li>2 pts: Explanations on code (written in English)</li>
<li>2 pts: Correct code</li>
</ul>
<p>You may (and should!) work with one other person on the problem sets, but you <strong>must</strong> turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>two</strong> people, and you must note who you worked with on your assignment.</p>
<h2 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Quizzes</span> are intended to reinforce the lectures and course reading materials. Quizzes will be given through Canvas and out-of-class and will consist of ten (10) multiple choice questions for each quiz. Quizzes will be closed-book, i.e., you <strong>cannot use any other resource</strong> (no phones, laptops, books, etc.).</p>
<p>I will try to review each quiz in the following class to provide feedback on each quiz. Your grades will be posted on Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="design-contest-mini-project">Design Contest / Mini-Project</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Too give you practice</span> with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete a mini-project. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions—you will make a static visualization plots.</p>
<p>Feel free to start thinking about ideas (datasets, research questions) now. This will be in groups of no more than 3 students per group.</p>
<p>This is worth <strong>10</strong> points. It will be submitted via Canvas as well as include an in-class, 10 minute presentation on <strong>October 28th</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final project</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.</p>
<p>Project details will be posted later on. This much is certain so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will use some sort of real-world, interactive data visualization (Shiny-based) some sort of research question.</li>
<li>The project will consist of a written report and a final presentation, which will be during our Exam class on December 9th.</li>
<li>It will be so much fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.</p>
