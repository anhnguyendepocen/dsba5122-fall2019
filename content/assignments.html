<h2 id="attendance-participation">Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend class and actively participate (e.g., ask questions, provide your perspective).</p>
<p>You are permitted to miss to have two (2) unexcused absences. Excused absences must be approved before the class.</p>
<h2 id="datacamp-courses">DataCamp Courses</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To reinforce programming concepts, </span> you will need to complete <strong>four</strong> DataCamp courses. Credit will either be granted for completion on time or no credit. These will be assigned on DataCamp and are intended to reinforce the programming assignments and material. <strong>No partial credit will be granted or any late work accepted.</strong></p>
<p>All four DataCamp courses are available at the beginning of the course. Therefore, you can begin DataCamp courses before we cover the related material.</p>
<h2 id="problem-sets">Problem sets</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To practice working with R/RStudio</span> and making data-based graphics, you will complete a series of 4 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will also be graded on the following point system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can your results be replicated? e.g., files run, includes .Rmd/.html files + data/images</li>
<li>Your explanations of the code written in grammatically correct English</li>
<li>The correctness of your code</li>
</ul>
<p>You may (and should!) work with one other person on the problem sets, but you <strong>must</strong> turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>two</strong> people, and you must note who you worked with on your assignment.</p>
<h2 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Quizzes</span> are intended to reinforce the lectures and course reading materials. Quizzes will be given out-of-class through Canvas. Each quiz will consist of ten (10) multiple choice questions for each quiz. Quizzes will be closed-book, i.e., you <strong>cannot use any other resource</strong> (no phones, laptops, books, etc.).</p>
<p>I will try to review each quiz in the following class to provide feedback on each quiz. Your grades will be posted on Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="design-contest-mini-project">Design Contest / Mini-Project</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To give you practice for the final project</span>, you will complete a mini-project halfway through the semester. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questionsâ€”you will make a static visualization plots.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to give you practice to design visualization solution for an interesting data problem. You are <strong>not</strong> expected to use interactive visualizations (e.g., Shiny, htmlwidgets) since we will not have covered that material in detail. Instead, you need to outline what skills/tools you want to learn more to better for the final project (e.g., what would you want to do if you could).</p>
<p>Feel free to start thinking about ideas (datasets, research questions) now. This will be in groups of no more than 3 students per group.</p>
<p>This project is worth 10% of your final grade. You will have an in-class, 10 minute presentation on <strong>October 28th</strong> and submit your materials in Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final project</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will demonstrate your data visualization skills by completing a final project.</p>
<p>Project details will be posted later on. This much is certain so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will use some sort of real-world, interactive data visualization (Shiny-based) some sort of research question.</li>
<li>The project will consist of a written report and a final 10 minute presentation, which will be during our Exam class on December 9th.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.</p>
