# Task 0: Getting started

Create a new RStudio project somewhere on your computer.^[{-} Remember, in RStudio, "File > New Project ..")] Open that new folder in Windows Explorer or macOS Finder (however you navigate around the files on your computer), and create a subfolder there named `data`.

Download the file below and place it in your new `data/` folder.^[{-} You'll probably need to right click on each and choose "Save link as…".]

- <i class="fas fa-table"></i> [Officer_Traffic_Stops.csv](http://clt-charlotte.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c458bca429b542bbb31130c23510628a_7.csv)

- <i class="fas fa-table"></i> [CMPD Division shape file](http://clt-charlotte.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/47167ee6d69248acbd825f2859c68dbf_5.zip)

For the shape file, this will come as a zip file. You will need to extract **all** the files in this folder into a sub-folder in your `/data/` folder.

[Download this R Markdown file](/files/your-name_problem-set-2.Rmd) and place it in your newly-created project^[{-} Again, you might have to right click on the link and choose "Save link as…".] It contains an outline/skeleton of the two tasks you'll need to do in this problem set. Lots of the code is pre-written again!

In the end, the structure of your new project directory should look something like this:

```
your-project-name\
  your-name_problem-set-2.Rmd
  your-project-name.Rproj
  data\
    Officer_Traffic_Stops.csv
    CMPD_Police_Divisions\
      CMPD_Police_Divisions.cpg
      CMPD_Police_Divisions.dbf
      CMPD_Police_Divisions.prj
      CMPD_Police_Divisions.shp
      CMPD_Police_Divisions.shx
```

# Task: CMPD Traffic Stops

^[{-} ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Jed4yKA1OlaFJPW/giphy.gif)] Follow the instructions in the [R Markdown file you downloaded](/files/your-name_problem-set-2.Rmd)).

You will need to do two things: either write in complete sentences a response or write R code to fill in a chunk.

- "xxxxx" = Write, in complete English sentences, your response. 1-2 sentences is sufficient.

- "**Plot**" = Write R code in the chunk corresponding to the instructions.

When you're done, submit a compressed (zipped) folder of your entire project including the knitted HTML file, R Markdown file, data folder, and RStudio Project of your analysis on Canvas. 

To complete the assignment, [upload here to Canvas](https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/110218/assignments/655332) by 11:59pm on October 7, 2019.

It's best if the final knitted document is clean and free of warnings and messages (so if a chunk is creating messages, like wherever you run `library(tidyverse)`, add `message=FALSE, warning=FALSE` to the chunk options).
