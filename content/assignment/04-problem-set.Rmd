# Task 0: Getting started

For this problem set, you'll learn `blogdown`, an R package that enables building websites through [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/), a web framework. Like shiny, `blogdown` enable you to use a more complex framework (i.e., Hugo) but through R functions and syntax that you've been learning about all semester.

I recommend running this exercise on your personal laptop, mainly so you'll have this blog site already saved on your own personal computer.

For this assignment, we'll primarily be using Xie, Thomas, and Hill's [`blogdown` book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). This is a long book and should be used as more of a reference than read from beginning to end.

# Task 1: Read Chapter 1

First, read [Chapter 1 from Xie, Thomas, and Hill](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html)'s Blogdown book.

# Task 2: Build your site (1 Point)

Following [Section 1.7](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html), we'll build a website:

1. Create a new R Project. 

2. install the `blogdown` package. 

3. Run `blogdown::install_hugo()` to install Hugo, which is the complementary web framework.

4. Check that Hugo was correctly installed by running `blogdown::hugo_version()`, where you should get `‘0.55.1’`.

5. Go to Tools > Project Options and select:

6. Select a [Hugo theme](http://themes.gohugo.io)

7. Build your website with the code: `blogdown::new_site(theme = 'user/repo')`

This will likely create a file pop up. Save that file as a template. It should be saved in the `content/post` folder.

# Task 3: Modify the `config.toml` file (1 Point)

In Hugo, the most important file is the configuration file: `config.toml`.

Read Chapters 2.1-2.2 to understand the basics of the file structures.

You should now see these files. Open `config.toml`.

1. Change the title,^[Think of a creative title name or just say "My Blog". You can always edit it later.] author name, color, homeSubtitle, and modify the social network (free feel to remove, add, or modify). Provide whatever names you want.

# Task 4: Create content and write your first post (1 Points)

To create new pages, you'll use RMarkdown. The key is the location of the files.

Create a new post by clicking on the `Addins` button:

![](/images/assignment/blogdown-2.png)

and choose "New Post".

Give your post a title, your name, and fill in tags (what can be searched) or other fields. Keep the subdirectory to "post", this is where the file will be created.

Modify the file to a .Rmd file at the bottom before creating the file. ^[This [chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html) describes the difference between a markdown and Rmarkdown file.]

Now open that new .Rmd file in RStudio to modify.

To finish, add in whatever you want! Code, data, plots, whatever. Simply write at least 100 lines of content.

# Task 5: Serve your site

You'll need to serve your site by updating it. Think of this as Knitting all possible files.

To do this, you'll need to click "Addins" again and click "Serve Site".

To learn more, see the [2nd section of this chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html).

# Task 6: Read through Chapter 2

Next, read through the rest of Chapter 2, especially [section 2.7 on static files](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html). This is the location where you can put files (e.g., images, pdf, gifs).

# Task 7: Deploy to Netlify (option 1: 1 point)

The simplest way to deploy your website is to put it on Netlify through drag and droping the contents of your `/public` folder.

To do this follow Allison Hill's [Hugo Troubleshooting steps](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-03-04-hugo-troubleshooting/#netlify-drag-and-drop).

# Task 7 (alternate): Deploy to Netlify via GitHub (option 2: 3 points)

For this task, you'll need to learn GitHub. You'll first need to create your own GitHub account as well as follow additional steps.

Follow the instructions by Allison Hill in her post: [Up and Running with `blogdown`](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/).

**Note!** Her blog is assuming using a Mac. While Windows users are welcome to try, the problem comes in with terminal (UNIX command line). 

I'd highly recommend Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html). But remember, learning GitHub can be challenging at first. This is why if you decide to do this task, be prepared to work with someone who can help you.

# What to provide for credit

To complete the assignment, simply provide the URL for your website on netlify on [Canvas](https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/100065/assignments/516674) by 11:59pm on Thursday, May 2, 2019.
