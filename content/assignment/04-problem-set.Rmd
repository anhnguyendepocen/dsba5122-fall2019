You will implement the shiny app shown in [Chapter 5 in Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-case-study.html) by Hadley Wickham.

# Task 1: app-1.R

Create a Shiny app based on [5.4](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-case-study.html). Call this file app-1.R.

To download, the files. This will put the files into a folder names 'neiss'.

```{r eval=F}
download.file("https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/raw/master/neiss/injuries.tsv.gz", "neiss/injuries.tsv.gz")
download.file("https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/raw/master/neiss/products.tsv", "neiss/products.tsv")
download.file("https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/raw/master/neiss/population.tsv", "neiss/population.tsv")
```

app-1.R should create this app:

# Task 2: app-2.R

Using app-1.R as a template/base, create a new file call app-2.R that starts with app-1.R. 

Follow the instructions in 5.5 Polish tables.

app-2.R should look like this:

# Task 3: app-3.R

Follow 5.6 Rate vs count to create app-3.R.

app-3.R should look like this:

# Task 4: app-4.R

Follow 5.7 Narrative and create app-4.R.

app-4.R should looks like this:

# Task 5: Make an Improvement

Create an enhancement on app-4.R and save it as app-5.R.

You can choose anything. A new layout, new shiny theme, add in a better ggplot2 theme. 

More creative choices will get more credit.

# Task 6: Zip your folder and load to Canvas

Save your folder as lastname-problem-set-04.zip.

It should have your data and be fully reproducible. You do not need to deploy your app to shinyapps.io.
