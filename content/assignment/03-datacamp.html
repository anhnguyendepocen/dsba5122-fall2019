<h2 id="datacamp-course-modified-for-this-assignment">DataCamp Course: (Modified for this assignment)</h2>
<p>DataCamp no longer offers their “Intro to Shiny”.</p>
<p>Instead, you have two options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Watch a 2.5 hour <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/">introduction to Shiny training video</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Go through and read RStudio’s <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/">Shiny Introduction Article Series</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since I can’t verify your completion, to complete this assignment you must submit on Canvas this statement: “On my honor, I have completed option X for DataCamp course 3.” (where you state whether you did #1 or #2 in place of X).</p>
