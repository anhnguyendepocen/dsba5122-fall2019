Here is the [link to the assigned course](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/dsba5122-visual-analytics-58036aae-d5c5-424e-aa2a-eab645c8a12a/assignments/42166).

For this DataCamp course, you'll learn about `shiny`, the framework for developing html-based interactive visualizations without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript experiment (though it will help tremendously if you have a background).
