Here is the [link to the assigned course](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/dsba5122-visual-analytics-c9a5d247-7ed7-44d0-bed6-e8d85e26b19e/assignments/55382).

For this DataCamp course, you'll learn about `shiny`, the framework for developing html-based interactive visualizations without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript experiment (though it will help tremendously if you have a background).
