# DataCamp Course: (Modified for this assignment)

DataCamp no longer offers their "Intro to Shiny".

Instead, you have two options:

1. Watch a 2.5 hour [introduction to Shiny training video](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

2. Go through and read RStudio's [Shiny Introduction Article Series](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/)

Since I can't verify your completion, to complete this assignment you must submit on Canvas this statement: "On my honor, I have completed option X for DataCamp course 3." (where you state whether you did #1 or #2 in place of X).
