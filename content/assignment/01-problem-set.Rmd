*Note*: to complete this task, you **MUST** submit your final folder (compressed as a zip file) through [here to Canvas](https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/110218/assignments/651583) by 11:59pm on September 9, 2019. Each person needs to submit their own folder! So if you work in pairs, both individuals have to submit a folder.

# Task 0

Make sure you install R and RStudio and tidyverse first.^[Follow [these instructions](/install/) and install R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages. If you have any questions, send a message on the class' Slack!] 

Create a [new R project as a "New Directory" (folder)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects). You should call your name project "problem-set-1-[yourlastname]", where [yourlastname] is your last name.

Within your new project folder, [download this R Markdown file](/files/problem-set-1/problem-set-1-yourlastname.Rmd).^[Your browser might show the file instead of downloading it. If that's the case, you can copy/paste the code from the browser to RStudio. In RStudio, go to "File" > "New" > "New R Markdown…", click "OK" with the default options, delete all the placeholder code/text in the new file, and paste the example code in the now-blank file.] It contains an outline/skeleton of what you'll need to do in this problem set, and it includes lots of the code prewritten just for you! Make sure to **change the 

Next, you'll need to download the csv file we'll be working with. [Click this link and "Save as"](/files/problem-set-1/data/rickmorty_char.csv) and put it into a folder within your new project called "/data/".

In the end, the structure of your new project directory should look like this:

```
problem-set-1-yourlastname\
  problem-set-1-yourlastname.Rmd
  problem-set-1-yourlastname.Rproj
  data\
    rickmorty_char.csv
```

Complete the two tasks below and type your answers in that downloaded file. When you're done, knit the document as a html file with the "Knit" button at the top of the script editing pane.^[![Knit button](/images/assignment/knit-button.png)]

# Task 1: Become familiar with RStudio and RMarkdown

In Task 2, you'll play with actual R commands and create graphics. Before we get there, you need to familiarize yourself with RStudio. Go through [this short tutorial](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html).

Finally, you will write future memos and problems sets in RMarkdown instead of Word. RStudio has [a helpful tutorial and a short video about R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). 

Go through these short lessons:

- [Introduction](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
- [How it Works](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html)
- [Code Chunks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
- [Inline Code](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html)
- [Markdown Basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html) ^[{-} The [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) is super useful here.]
- [Output Formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html)

Before doing these R Markdown tutorials, you'll need to install a couple more R packages. Use RStudio's "Packages" panel to install `rmarkdown` and `viridis`. Alternatively, paste these commands in the RStudio Console: `install.packages("rmarkdown")` and `install.packages("viridis")`. ^[You can also type `install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "viridis"))` to install both at the same time.]

Don't worry if you don't completely understand RMarkdown!^[See [R4DS Chapter 27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) if you need some help.] Try your hardest and play around with it.

^[{-} Also, (**optional**) if you want to convert R Markdown files to PDF instead of just Word or HTML, you'll need to install LaTeX, which is a fancy scientific typesetting program. You don't need to know how it works—it just has to be installed for R to use it.

The easiest way to install it is with the **tinytex** R package. Run these two lines in your R console to install a smaller version of LaTeX that should work great for this class:

```{r install-tinytex, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

If you want to use a full-blown LaTeX installation, install one of these. But note that *you don't need to do this!*

- LaTeX for macOS: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/). For whatever reason, LaTeX is astoundingly huge and it will feel like you're downloading the entire internet when you install it. Be patient :).
- LaTeX for Windows: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex)]

For this task, there are three questions you will need to answer. They can be answered in the .Rmd file within your project ("problem-set-1-yourlastname.Rmd").


# Task 2: Analyzing Rick and Morty Characters with R

As a fun starter, we'll analyze the different characters in the show "Rick and Morty".^[{-} ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/i2dE5VvBNxBw4/giphy.gif)]

You'll use the same .Rmd file you previously used and have three different types of tasks to do.

- "xxxxx" = Write, in complete English sentences, your response to questions. 1-2 sentences is sufficient.

- "**Code**" = Write R code in the chunk corresponding to the instructions.

- "**Google**" = Google (or use a different search engine of your choice) the answer to this question.

In total there are 

# All done!

Knit the completed R Markdown file as a **html** (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and **compress** the entire folder as a zip file (including the html document, RStudio Project, any respective data, and the R Markdown file). 

To complete the assignment, [upload here to Canvas](https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/100065/assignments/516650) by 11:59pm on September 9, 2019. Each person needs to submit their own folder (zip file). (Example: if you work with someone else, you each have to submit your own zip file!)
