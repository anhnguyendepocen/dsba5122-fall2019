# Required

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 6: Work with Models](http://socviz.co/modeling.html) in Healy.

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 22: Model introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html)  and [Chapter 23: Model basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) in Wickham/Grolemund.

# Recommended 

- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Chapter 6: Basic Regression](https://moderndive.com/6-regression.html) from "ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R" by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim.^[This is an outstanding new book -- with a free online version -- that will be a big complement to the tidyverse in the future. We could have spent much more time on this book and I encourage anyone interested in applying statistical models to read the later chapters.]

- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Intro to `parsnip` R package](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/parsnip_Intro.html) by Max Kuhn and Davis Vaughn.
