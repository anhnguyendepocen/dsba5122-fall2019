# Using R/RStudio

.pull-left[
# RStudio Locally

- **Pros**: It's on your computer. 

- **Cons**: Different settings (OS, versions, packages, etc.) can make sharing/replication painful.

.pull-right[
# RStudio.Cloud

- **Benefits**: Clean environment, easy to replicate/share

- **Cons**: Sometimes slow or down (cost of free), limited to 1GB of memory

- Use RStudio.Cloud to run in-class demos and test purposes but use local version for your homeworks and projects.

- FYI there's also [Docker](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/) and/or [Cloud](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/04/27/super-basic-practical-guide-to-docker-and-rstudio/) approaches!
