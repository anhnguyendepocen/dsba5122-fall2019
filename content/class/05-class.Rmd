# Tweet of the Day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My <a href="https://twitter.com/tapestryconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tapestryconf</a> talk is now in video form: A biased tour of the uncertainty visualization zoo. If you liked the version with just slides, you&#39;ll love (?) the version with me talking over slides :) <a href="https://t.co/hSdczZlgKW">https://t.co/hSdczZlgKW</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Kay (@mjskay) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjskay/status/1071139021231964162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>^[Matthew Kay is an assistant professor of Information at the University of Michigan School of Information. His research focuses on communicating uncertainty, especially from a Bayesian perspective including authoring the [`tidybayes` package](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/). If you're new to Bayesian statistics, he has an [excellent paper](http://www.mjskay.com/papers/chi_2016_bayes.pdf) on why Bayesian statistics is appropriate for human-centered (HCI) research. I also highly recommend [his research appearance on the DataStories podcast](http://datastori.es/134-visualizing-uncertainty-with-jessica-hullman-and-matthew-kay/) with his colleague, Jessica Hullman.]

This gets at the core difference between Bayesian and Frequentist schools of thought.]

Pierre Dragicevic's ["Fair statistical communication in HCI"](../../readings/dragicevic-fair-reporting.pdf) paper.^[This paper is an excellent guide for ways to appropriately communicate statistical models and uncertainty. This provides a good background on why overemphasis on p-values and dichotomous testing can go wrong and miss important perspectives when doing hypothesis testing.]

# Lab:

Claus Wilke's 2019 RStudio::Conf talk on [Visualizing uncertainty with hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs)
](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zMuBSADaxdFnosOPWJNA10DaxGEheW6gDxqEPYAuado/edit#slide=id.p1) / [GitHub Code](https://gist.github.com/clauswilke/423644418adfe83ad7f07cdc384cb17b) / [`ungeviz` package](https://wilkelab.org/ungeviz/)^[You can watch Claus' talk [here](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/visualizing-uncertainty-with-hypothetical-outcomes-plots)!]

For the lab session, update [last week's `gganimate` folder](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/7976/project/211237) on our RStudio.cloud course page.

If we have time, I also included Matthew Kay's [Uncertainty visualization examples](https://github.com/mjskay/uncertainty-examples) in the RStudio.cloud project (see uncertainty-examples folder).
