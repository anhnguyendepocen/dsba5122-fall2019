There are other great posts by Tyler like [doing 3D `ggplot` charts](https://www.tylermw.com/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader/) and [3D maps with `rayshader`](https://www.tylermw.com/3d-maps-with-rayshader/).  Please note - like anything cutting edge -  this package may have bugs and dependencies that require you to set up the right tools. So only pursue if you're up for the challenge.]
