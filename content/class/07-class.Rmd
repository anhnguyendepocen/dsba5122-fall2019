3. RMeetup Group for optional final project presentation in December meeting. We had 21 students respond with "Yes". Therefore, I'm going to book our class as presenting up to five group projects for the last RMeetup Group. You don't have to do anything, simply mark your calendars for Tuesday, December 17 from 12-1pm at CenterCity. 

4. [DataCamp 3](../../assignment/03-datacamp.html) is due in 3 weeks (November 5) DataCamp no longer offers Intro to Shiny so have two options, which you'll need to report on Canvas. Please see page for details.

# Lab: Text and t-SNE

1. We'll run text application in [this RStudio.cloud project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/22733/project/610781). This uses `reticulate` package, allowing python packages.

2. For this data set, we'll use a sample of the [CFPB Public Complaints data set](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?from=0&searchField=all&searchText=&size=25&sort=created_date_desc). We'll just use a sample of credit reporting (product) issues.

3. We'll use a technique called t-SNE to represent the text dataset. <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> Wattenberg, et al., ["How to Use t-SNE Effectively"](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne), Distill, 2016. http://doi.org/10.23915/distill.00002

4. TensorFlow Projector Dimensionality Reduction on Word Embeddings: <https://projector.tensorflow.org/>
