# Tweet of the day

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Visual encoding is itself a data transformation, often applied after a chain of other transformations. This is “first week of class”, table stakes stuff. Sad if true that we don’t internalize this!</p>&mdash; Jeffrey Heer (@jeffrey_heer) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrey_heer/status/1028353025889333248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2018</a></blockquote>

# Announcements

1. Make sure you're signed-up for RStudio, DataCamp, and Slack. See your emails for class links -- you need to use email links to sign up, not the links on this course website!

2. [DataCamp 1](../../assignment/01-datacamp.html) is due next Tuesday, Sept 3rd by 11:59pm that night. You need to complete the entire course for credit. You do not need to submit anything by Canvas. I can see when you complete the entire course and will manually update your grade on Canvas. Per course syllabus, **50% credit** if late within 24 hours. **0% credit** if late after 24 hours.

3. [Problem Set 1](../../assignment/01-problem-set.html) is delayed one week - now due Monday, Sept 16th. Bring questions to next class Monday, Sept 9th (no class next week due to Labor Day).

4. [DataCamp 3](../../assignment/03-datacamp.html) changed. DataCamp no longer offers Intro to Shiny. New instructions are posted on the assignment page.

5. A few **optional** DataCamp courses were provided. These are to help students who are brand new to R and data importing, cleaning, and manipulation. They will not be graded.
