</span></span> By itself, the facts contained in raw data are difficult to understand, and in the absence of beauty and order, it is impossible to understand the truth that the data shows.</p>
<p>In this class, you’ll learn how to use industry-standard graphic and data design techniques to create beautiful, understandable visualizations and uncover truth in data.</p>
<h2 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h2>
<!-- <span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will become (1) literate in data and graphic design principles, (2) an ethical data communicator, and (3) a collaborative sharer by producing beautiful, powerful, and clear visualizations of your own data. Specifically, you should: -->
<!-- - Understand the principles of data and graphic design -->
<!-- - Evaluate the credibility, ethics, and aesthetics of data visualizations -->
<!-- - Create well-designed data visualizations with appropriate tools -->
<!-- - Share data and graphics in open forums -->
<!-- - Be curious and confident in consuming and producing data -->
<!-- Given these objectives, this course fulfills two of the four learning outcomes for BYU's [Master of Public Administration (MPA)](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/) program:  -->
<!-- - **Quantitative Analysis**: BYU MPA graduates are skilled at evaluating programs and policies. They know how to gather data, correctly analyze it, and employ the analysis to recommend policy and programmatic action in public service organizations. -->
<!-- - **Communications**: BYU MPA graduates effectively convey verbal and written information with the polish and professionalism appropriate for the public service context. They listen to and promote understanding among people with diverse viewpoints. -->

<p>There will also occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend subscribing to the <a href="https://rweekly.org/">R Weekly newsletter</a>. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.</p>
<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You will do all of your visualization work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free <a href="http://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio.cloud</a> service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.</p>
<p>RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/install/">find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.</a></p>
<h3 id="online-help-and-slack">Online help and Slack</h3>
<p>Computer programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).</p>
<p>Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).</p>
<p>Searching for help with R on Google can be tricky because the program is, um, a single letter. Try searching for “rstats” instead. If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a class chatroom at <a href="https://unccdsba5122s2019.slack.com">Slack</a> where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about the readings, problem sets, and projects <a href="https://unccdsba5122s2019.slack.com">in the class Slack workspace</a>. I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should also all do so as well. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p>
<h2 id="classroom-policies">Classroom policies</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.</span></p>
<h3 id="orderly-and-productive-classroom-conduct">Orderly and productive classroom conduct</h3>
<p>I will conduct this class in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I encourage your active participation in class discussions. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the various topics of class discussions. The conflict of ideas is encouraged and welcome. The orderly questioning of the ideas of others, including mine, is similarly welcome. However, I will exercise my responsibility to manage the discussions so that ideas and argument can proceed in an orderly fashion. You should expect that if your conduct during class discussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will not be permitted to participate further.</p>
<h3 id="recording-in-the-classroom">Recording in the classroom</h3>
<p>Electronic video and/or audio recording is not permitted during class unless the student obtains permission from the instructor. If permission is granted, any distribution of the recording is prohibited. Students with specific electronic recording accommodations authorized by the Office of Disability Services do not require instructor permission; however, the instructor must be notified of any such accommodation prior to recording. Any distribution of such recordings is prohibited.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-of-grades-and-performance">Discussion of grades and performance</h3>
<p>Such discussion shall occur between the student and the instructor(s). Sharing information regarding grades and performance in places such as discussion forums or email blasts is prohibited.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-student-responsibility">Code of Student Responsibility</h3>
<p>“The UNC Charlotte Code of Student Responsibility(the Code) sets forth certain rights and responsibilities in matters of student discipline. The Code defines these responsibilities and guarantees you certain rights that ensure your protection from unjust imposition of disciplinary penalties. You should familiarize yourself with the provisions and procedures of the Code” (Introductory statement from the UNC Charlotte brochure about the Code of Student Responsibility). The entire document may be found at this Internet address: <a href="http://legal.uncc.edu/policies/ps-104.html" class="uri">http://legal.uncc.edu/policies/ps-104.html</a></p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>All students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as provided in the Code. Students are expected to submit their own work, either as individuals or contributors to a group assignment. Definitions and examples of plagiarism and other violations are set forth in the Code. The Code is available from the Dean of Students Office or online at: <a href="http://www.legal.uncc.edu/policies/ps-105.html" class="uri">http://www.legal.uncc.edu/policies/ps-105.html</a> (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.</p>
<p>Faculty may ask students to produce identification at examinations and may require students to demonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work.</p>
